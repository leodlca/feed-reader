### Feed Reader (Unit Testing) - Front-End Project 6 

## About the project

The unit testing of Feed Reader was developed using Jasmine, a Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript. The goal was to create multiple layers of testing so the app can be safely updated in the future knowing that you're not breaking any previous feature.
